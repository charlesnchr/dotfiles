# Capture pane output in zellij and open in editor
# Equivalent to tmux-capture-last-command-output plugin

# Zellij has built-in scrollback, but capturing to file requires dump-screen
# or using the edit-scrollback feature

# Option 1: Use zellij's edit-scrollback action (opens in $EDITOR)
echo "Launching scrollback editor..."
zellij action edit-scrollback

# The above opens the scrollback in your $EDITOR (nvim)
# If you want to save to a specific file instead, use:
# zellij action dump-screen /tmp/zellij-capture.txt
# nvim /tmp/zellij-capture.txt
